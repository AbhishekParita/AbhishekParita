## 🔭 What I'm Working On  

- **Large-scale BGP anomaly detection** as an AI/ML Developer Intern at **Advantal Technologies**
- Designing **LSTM Autoencoder–based sequence models** for network traffic anomaly detection
- Building **ensemble detection systems** (LSTM Autoencoder + Isolation Forest + rule-based heuristics)
- Implementing **model drift detection and automated retraining pipelines**
- Developing **FastAPI-based ML services** integrated with **PostgreSQL** for monitoring and analytics

---

## 👯 Open to Collaborate On  

- Anomaly detection (network security, fraud detection, rare-event modeling)
- Time-series and sequential data modeling
- Production-grade ML systems (monitoring, drift detection, retraining)
- Research-oriented or open-source AI/ML projects

---

## 🤝 Looking For Help With  

- Advanced deep learning architectures for time-series data  
  (Temporal CNNs, Transformers, hybrid models)
- Improving **robustness, false-positive control, and drift handling** in anomaly detection systems
- Scaling ML pipelines and gaining deeper **PyTorch-first production experience**
